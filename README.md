# Task-Management-System

Creating a task management system where users can create, update, delete, and assign tasks to team members. The system has authentication and authorization mechanisms, allowing different users to have different levels of access to tasks. The backend is developed using Java (Spring Boot) for the REST API and MySQL for the database. The frontend is developed using JavaScript (with a framework like React.js) for the user interface.


Technologies Used:

Backend:

-> Java

-> Spring Boot

-> MySQL


Frontend:

-> JavaScript (React.js)

Additional Tools:

-> Maven (for Java dependency management)

-> npm (for JavaScript package management)


Features:

-> User Authentication and Authorization: Implement user authentication (login, registration) and authorization (role-based access control) using Spring Security.

-> Task CRUD Operations: Allow users to create, read, update, and delete tasks.

-> Task Assignment: Users with appropriate permissions can assign tasks to team members.

-> Task Filtering and Sorting: Implement filtering and sorting options for tasks based on different parameters like status, priority, assignee, etc.

-> Search Functionality: Allow users to search for tasks based on keywords.

-> Dashboard: Create a dashboard where users can view their tasks, tasks assigned to their team, and overall task statistics.

-> Notifications: Implement notifications for task assignments, updates, and deadlines.

-> RESTful API: Develop a RESTful API using Spring Boot to handle backend operations.

-> Error Handling: Implement proper error handling and validation for user inputs.

-> Database Integration: Use MySQL to store task-related data and integrate it with the Spring Boot application.

How to Use:

-> Clone both the backend and frontend repositories to your local machine.

-> Set up the MySQL database by running the provided SQL scripts (if any) in the backend repository.

-> Configure the backend application properties to connect to your MySQL database.

-> Install dependencies for both backend and frontend using Maven and npm, respectively.

-> Start the backend server.

-> Start the frontend server.

-> Access the application in your web browser.
